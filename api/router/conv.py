jwt :

conv_id
time_stamp: for each conversation

user_id
last_session: timestamp


get database handling here

MESSAGE HANDLER

TO DO THE FOLLOWING APPROACH CREATE

async def get_conv_id()


TO DO:
1. GET MY CONVERSATION ---> USE CONVERSATION ID TO FETCH THE ONE PARTICULAR CONVERSATION

# jwt ---> [user_id,conv_id -- current_conv] --> store cookie
2. GET CONVERSATION HISTORY ---> USE JWT TO GET ALL THE CONVERSATION OF THE PARTICULAR USER : IF USER LOGGED IN


3. GET CONVERSATION FROM COOKIES ---> IF USER IS NOT LOGGED IN
    STORING ALL THE CONVERSATION OF THE USERS IN COOKIES SO THAT
    ONCE HE CLOSED THE BROWSER COOKIES WILL BE DESTROYED

4. DELETE CONVERSATION ---> USE CONVERSATION ID TO DELETE THE PARTIUCLAR CONVERSATION

5. DELETE ALL CONVERSATION ---> USE EMAIL_ID/USER_ID TO DELETE ALL CONVERSATION
    #guest-mode ---> cookie(user_id --> random user_id genearate for every session)
    userid --> random uuid --> python --> cookie_store --> get id using cookie ---> timeout [1hr] ---> delete chats

    store 
    user_id  ----> global variables ---> easily we can fetch this in js and send id ---> python routes ke undar
    conv_id 

6. UPDATE CONVERSATION_TITLE --> GET CONV_ID ---> AND UPDATE THE TITLE OF CONV IN DB

7. GENERATE_CONV_TITLE ---> USE CONV_ID --> TO GENERATE_THE TITLE 
    CONV_TITLE --> WILL BE BASED ON THE FIRST QUESTION
